# Black Seal

A port of the original Black Seal mod to newer versions of Steamodded. This mod adds a rare black seal to the game that provides powerful negative edition effects.

## How It Works

When a card with black seal is used, it will apply **negative edition** to a random eligible joker.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Cleanup**: All other black seals in the deck will be removed when triggered (seals on cards in hand are kept)
- **Rare Spawn**: Can be found anywhere a random seal may appear, most commonly in booster packs with a 2% base chance
- **Configurable Spawn Rate**: The spawn chance relative to all other seals can be configured (defaults to 10%)
- **Ectoplasm Override**: Can override the 'Ectoplasm' spectral card to add a black seal instead of its normal effect
- **Hand Reduction Toggle**: When Ectoplasm override is active, you can also disable the hand reduction effect

## Installation

1. **Requirements**: Download and install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)
2. **Download**: Get the latest version of Black Seal from the releases
3. **Install Location**: Extract to `%appdata%\Balatro\Mods` on Windows
4. **Configuration**: Adjust spawn rates and Ectoplasm behavior through the mod settings

## Configuration Options

- **Spawn Rate**: Adjust how frequently black seals appear relative to other seals
- **Ectoplasm Override**: Enable/disable replacing Ectoplasm's effect with black seal application
- **Hand Reduction**: When using Ectoplasm override, toggle whether the hand size reduction still occurs
